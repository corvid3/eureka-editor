Changes for 2.0.0
=================

dd.mm.yyyy

----------
29.06.2024
* The tags check is now aware of the linedef special so it doesn't look for tagged sector if the
  special doesn't deal with sectors.

----------
24.06.2024
* Now sprites are displayed with rotations both in 2D and 3D views.

----------
22.06.2024
* Now resources can be loaded as PK3/PKE arranged folders.
* Spectral sprite view also shows up as such in the editor views, not just the sprite browser.

----------
25.05.2024
* Fixed the initial grid being set one step higher than intended in preferences.
* Removed the non-existent "dotty" option from grid's default mode documentation.

----------
01.05.2024
* Added Dehacked resource support, by contribution of Isaac Col√≥n (https://github.com/iccolon818).

----------
20.04.2024
* Testing map now opens the game without blocking Eureka, just like user would start another app.
  Also, for macOS you can now use the app bundle.
* Deleted Makefile.xming.

----------
07.10.2023
* Now dragging lines or sectors can also split other lines. Currently still no support for the
  dragged lines getting split by existing vertices.

----------
11.08.2023
* Added tutti-frutti texture check
* Fixed Heretic torches looking wrong in the 3D mode
* Fixed Heretic multiplayer sprite color translation

----------
24.10.2022
* Thing definition sprite lookup is now smarter and doesn't need full names for certain frames (e.g.
  BOSA1C1). In consequence, mods which change the rotation distributions won't be affected.

----------
12.10.2022
* Fixed the EUREKA lump to store relative paths so that the user settings are portable between
  computers.

----------
09.10.2021
* Removed the Hexen format support from Eternity. This format is only meant for vanilla Hexen wads
  and should not be used for new maps when UDMF is available.

----------
08.10.2021
* Now the tagged items (regardless of type) get highlighted properly, depending on the triggering
  special.

----------
05.10.2021
* Fixed an access violation happening when starting a new ZDoom project.

----------
01.10.2021
* Now the menu commands show their actual shortcuts as set in user preferences.

----------
19.09.2021
* Now the Jump to Objects dialog allows you to choose multiple items.

----------
22.08.2021
* Fixed missing 'm' texture category from heretic.ugh. Added it and named it "magic".

----------
19.05.2021
* Fixed so clicking a button while editing a panel field won't reset the field.

----------
16.05.2021
* Fixed a bug where dragging a vertex into a neighbouring linedef to split it resulted in two overlapping lines.

----------
07.05.2021
* Fixed a crash happening when starting a new project while a linedef is selected.

----------
05.03.2021
* Fixed a crash happening when using R to change sidedef offset in 3D mode on a selected (but not highlighted) linedef.

----------
18.02.2021
* Do not throw a fatal error when loading invalid project resource files (other than broken UGH files).
